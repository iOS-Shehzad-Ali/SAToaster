SAToaster is designed to show useful alerts or messages to the user. It's taking much care care of your view controller in terms of appearance. e.g. If a view controller having tab bar then toaster will be on top of it or if a view controller is used as a child view controller then it is treated in different way. Hope sounds good ðŸ˜Š.
